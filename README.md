## [JFrog MCP Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coralized-JFrog-MCP)
 
JFrog MCP Agent is a specialized agent for managing and interacting with JFrog Artifactory repositories, providing comprehensive repository management, package information retrieval, and vulnerability assessment capabilities through the Coral Protocol ecosystem.

## Responsibility
JFrog MCP Agent acts as the primary interface for JFrog Artifactory management within multi-agent workflows. It handles repository creation and configuration, package vulnerability analysis, build management, cluster monitoring, and permission management, enabling seamless integration of JFrog services into automated DevOps pipelines.

## Details
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Tools used**: JFrog MCP Tools, Coral MCP Tools
- **AI model**: GPT-4o, supports configurable LLM providers
- **Date added**: June 30, 2025
- **License**: MIT

## Setup the Agent

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

<details>  

```bash
# In a new terminal clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coralized-JFrog-MCP.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd Coral-JFrogMCP-Agent

# Install `uv`:
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
uv sync
```

</details>

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Get the required credentials:
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or other LLM provider
- [JFrog Access Token](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-platform-administration-documentation/access-tokens)

<details>

```bash
# Create .env file in project root
cp -r env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:
- `API_KEY`: Your LLM provider API key
- `CORAL_SSE_URL`: Coral server SSE endpoint URL
- `CORAL_AGENT_ID`: Your Coral agent identifier
- `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN`: JFrog platform access token
- `JFROG_URL`: Your JFrog instance URL (e.g., https://mycompany.jfrog.io)

Optional environment variables:
- `MODEL_NAME`: LLM model name (default: "gpt-4o")
- `MODEL_PROVIDER`: LLM provider (default: "openai")
- `MODEL_TEMPERATURE`: Model temperature (default: "0.3")
- `MODEL_TOKEN`: Max tokens (default: "4000")

</details>

## Run the Agent

You can run in either of the below modes to get your system running.  

- The Executable Model is part of the Coral Protocol Orchestrator which works with [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio).  
- The Dev Mode allows the Coral Server and all agents to be separately running on each terminal without UI support.  

### 1. Executable Mode

Checkout: [How to Build a Multi-Agent System with Awesome Open Source Agents using Coral Protocol](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/existing-agent-sessions-tutorial-private-temp) and update the file: `coral-server/src/main/resources/application.yaml` with the details below, then run the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) and [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio). You do not need to set up the `.env` in the project directory for running in this mode; it will be captured through the variables below.

```

For Windows, create a powershell command (run_agent.ps1) and run:

```bash
command: ["powershell","-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass", "-File", "${PROJECT_DIR}/run_agent.ps1","jfrog-mcp_coral_agent.py"]
```

### 2. Dev Mode

Ensure that the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) is running on your system and run below command in a separate terminal.

<details>

```bash
# Run the agent using `uv`:
uv run python jfrog-mcp_coral_agent.py
```
